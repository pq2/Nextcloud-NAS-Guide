The Not-supported Menu of the Nextcloud-VM features some exciting new scripts which provide a complete Backup solution, a script to manage a SMB-server and much more.

**Copy and paste into your CLI:**
```shell
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/main/not-supported/not-supported.sh -P /var/scripts
```
:::note
Although it says in the Menu that the offered scripts in this Menu are not ready yet, they are successfully tested!
